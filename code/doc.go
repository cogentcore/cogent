/*
Package code is the top-level repository for the Cogent Code Go-IDE based on
the Cogent Core GUI framework.

The following sub-packages provide all the code:

* code: is the main codebase for the IDE, in library form which can be
used in different contexts.

* codev: provides the CodeView that is the actual GUI widget for the full IDE

* piv: is the GUI viewer for the Cogent Core interactive parser; it is here because
it incorporates the Code toolkit and Code can run it as a sub-editor.

* cmd: is where the actual command tools are built.
